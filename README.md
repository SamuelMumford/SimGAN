# SimGAN

Files needed to run the training for the SimGAN and CycleGAN models (with data excluded)

The main training file is SimGanTrainCL.py, used to train using terminal command line arguments on a AWS GPU. I train with batches of 64 images, saving every 50 iterations and displaying progress every 25.
