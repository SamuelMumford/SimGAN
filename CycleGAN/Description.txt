Most of the files needed to run the CycleGAN code are provided at the main page: https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/

I have included some helper code used to split the file outputs and create folders of files.

I cannot update the weights for the generators I have trained because they are larger than the 25MB limit. The discriminators are here.
